# Python Work

Hi! Jackson here.

This is a reposotory of the things I made duing and after my Complete Python 3 course.

This reposotory contains some simple games, side projects, and some things I did while messing around.

The work that I am most proud of here are the [Tic Tac Toe](./games/tic_tac_toe.py) and [Blackjack](./games/blackjack.py) games, and as such those will be the files with the most documentation, and the ones presented in my video.

I will still try and add some documentation to my other work (primarily the stuff located in the [school](./school/) folder), but it may not be as detailed.

Thanks for reading!
