# DDD – Skills of the Future Programming Work

Hi! This is Jackson.

This repository will contain my [python](./Python/) and [javascript](./Javascript/) work that I've done, with some additional documentation and explenation.

My main priority will be my python work, and as such that will have the most documentation.<br>
Because of this, the javascript work will likely have sub-par or missing documentation, but I will still try my best to have at least some there.

- [Python Work](./Python/)
- [Javascript Work](./Javascript/)

Thanks for reading!
